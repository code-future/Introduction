<a id="what-is-codefuture" class="anchor" href="#what-is-codefuture" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is CodeFuture?</h3>

<p>CodeFuture's mission is to teach programming to the youth by providing them infinite opportunities to apply their skills. In short, this is not like any other summer camp, class, or after school program. CodeFuture's curriculum is purely online based, but is still heavily interactive with instructors, technical mentors, and other students. </p>

<h3>
<a id="so-how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#so-how-does-it-work" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So how does it work?</h3>

<p>CodeFuture's curriculum revolves around the Sprint, a mini-project that has some, but not all, of the code written already. It is the student's job to complete the Sprint by building out the recommended functionality, or even by designing and implementing their own features. There is no pass or fail, there is no right or wrong. Every week the student will meet virtually (via Google Hangouts) with an instructor, who will review the previous week's Sprint as well as introduce the new Sprint. Additionally, once the student completes the Help Desk Sprint, the student will have 24/7 access to instructors and mentors via the app they built! </p>
