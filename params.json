  "body": "### What is CodeFuture?\r\nCodeFuture's mission is to teach programming to the youth by providing them infinite opportunities to apply their skills. In short, this is not like any other summer camp, class, or after school program. CodeFuture's curriculum is purely online based, but is still heavily interactive with instructors, technical mentors, and other students. \r\n\r\n### So how does it work?\r\nCodeFuture's curriculum revolves around the Sprint, a mini-project that has some, but not all, of the code written already. It is the student's job to complete the Sprint by building out the recommended functionality, or even by designing and implementing their own features. There is no pass or fail, there is no right or wrong. Every week the student will meet virtually (via Google Hangouts) with an instructor, who will review the previous week's Sprint as well as introduce the new Sprint. Additionally, once the student completes the Help Desk Sprint, the student will have 24/7 access to instructors and mentors via the app they built! \r\n\r\n### Curriculum\r\n\r\nPlease note that this timeline is merely a suggestion!\r\n\r\nWeek 1: Let's Make a To Do List\r\n  - Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the three main languages of the Web\r\n  - Student will learn how all 3 work together to create a To Do List app.\r\n\r\n \r\nWeek 2: Let's Make Our List...Better\r\n  - Add some additional functionality to our To Do List\r\n  - Introduction to jQuery, a powerful library.\r\n  - Bonus: Deploy your application on the world wide web for friends and family to use!\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 3: Help Desk Sprint\r\n  - In this Sprint, students will build a portal for them to chat with CodeFuture instructors for code help.\r\n  - Introduction to AJAX and databases\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 4 and Beyond coming soon!\r\n\r\n### Scheduling\r\nCodeFuture requires at least one day a week for a hour-long Live Lesson between an instructor and the student. Additionally, the student should look to spend anywhere from 2 - 5 hours per week on completing the Sprint. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nEmail me at (w.zachary.lee@gmail.com), call me at 7132021535\r\n\r\n",
